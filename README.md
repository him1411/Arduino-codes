# arduino-shortest-distance-bot
### Based on djikstras algorithm of travelling salesman problem.
I wanted it to be a real life implementation of the travelling salesman problem using an arduino bot. which detects plastic bottles using 2 ultrasound sensors and follows greedy algorithm to implement it.
